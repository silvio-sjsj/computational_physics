### Examples:

- `exmp_2-1_dropped.py`: Example 2.1: A Ball dropped from a tower - example from the book with imrpovements: given the height of a tower as a initial_position it computes the position of a ball dropped with initial velocity zero after a time interval t, given by the user, had passed.

- `exmp_2-2_coord_convert.py`: Example 2.2: Converting polar coordinates. **But also converting cartesian coordinates!**. This is an improved code for the example 2.2. Here, through command line or user `input()` this program converts coordinates in polar scheme to cartesian scheme, but can also convert from cartesian scheme to polar scheme. The user inputs its coordinates and the input scheme and the program returns the coordinates converted.

### Exercises:

- `exrc_2-1_dropped.py`: Exercise 2.1: Another Ball Dropped from a Tower. Calculates the time interval taking by a ball to hit the ground when it is dropped by a tower of height h and initial velocity v. This exercise have been modified a little bit from the original statement to also account for initial velocity different from zero.

- `exrc_2-2_h_satellite`: Exercise 2.2: Altitude of a satellite. Computes the altitude of a satelite given an oribt period T.

- `exrc_2-3_coord_convert.py`: Exercise 2.3 from the book. This is exactly the same code given in `exmp_2-2` (while I was working on example 2-2 I implemented the inverse transformation without knowing that this would be actually the next exercise).

- `exrc_2-4_relat_t.py`: Exercise 2.4 from the book. Spaceship travelling to a planet. Computes the relativistic time and the proper time for a spaceship travelling with velocity that is some fraction from the speed of light to a planet that is x light years away from the Earth.
