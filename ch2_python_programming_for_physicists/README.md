### Examples:

- `exmp_2-1_dropped.py`: Example 2.1: A Ball dropped from a tower - example from the book with imrpovements: given the height of a tower as a initial_position it computes the position of a ball dropped with initial velocity zero after a time interval t, given by the user, had passed.

### Exercises:

- `exrc_2-1_dropped.py`: Exercise 2.1: Another Ball Dropped from a Tower. Calculates the time interval taking by a ball to hit the ground when it is dropped by a tower of height h and initial velocity v. This exercise have been modified a little bit from the original statement to also account for initial velocity different from zero.

- `exrc_2-2_h_satellite`: Exercise 2.2: Altitude of a satellite. Computes the altitude of a satelite given an oribt period T.
