### Computational Physics - examples and exercises

#### Book by Mark Newman
#### Solutions by Silvio Jonas da Silva
#### All solutions with Python programming language.

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises and Physics problems from the book ["Computational Phsyics" by Mark Newman](https://public.websites.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/).
The idea is to update this repository so in the near future it can provide solutions to every exercise in the book. I will also upload codes to the examples given in the book trying to put some minor changes so it can be presented more in the form of a closed program. 

The examples and exercises in the book gives general ideas of clean coding and are useful for every student in scientific fields, specially of course in Physics, as undergradutes trying to learn more sofisticated machinery in computation to better develop their skills as programmers. Physics nowadays, actually all scientific research in Physics in the last 60 or 70 years made heavy usage of computers and programming languages and even so in many undergradutes schools students barely touch computers to solve problems or translate basic physics, like any exercise in Physics 101 about balls being dropped from towers without air resistance, into programming languages. This book aims to suply students with material to fill this gap and this repository came really late in my life but can suply students with ideas for solutions to this kind of exercises and even tough they are just for self-learning and most of all, for fun, it is worth the effort.

Translating the mathematical equations of Physics into code is another face of problem-solving that students in scientific areas must be equiped with. The design of codes, the usage of different programming languages, data visualization and 2D and 3D plots with or without animation are skills that can be of no less than excelent for every student independently of what they will do after the undergrad college.

## What you will find in the `.py` files inside the folders above:

Every `.py` file starts with on of the following prefix:

- `exmp_x-y`: corresponds to examples given in the book. The original code is given in the book as example but I tried to add some minor changes to then so it can be presented as a closed program. Sometimes I add the possibility of command line arguments to call the program from the terminal, which is a feature of programming that I think is worth learning and understanding and that can be presented to students as soon as they start learning how to use a computer. In the name of the file `x`refers to the chapter and `y` to the numbered example inside that chapter. Thus, `exmp_2-1` is the first example from the second chapter while `exmp_3-1` is the first example from the third chapter and so on.

- `exrc_x-y`: corresponds to the exercises that I solved from the book. Every `.py` file comes with the statement of the exercise as given in the book as well as with my solution to them. All of them are my original solutions corresponding to my efforst in solving them. I will try to cover every exercise from the book and upload every possible solution here. This is a free resource and I hope it can be useful to someone. The names of the files to the exercises follows the same structure as the one for the examples with regards to the `x` and `y` stuff.  

## What you will find in each folder:

### [0_examples](https://github.com/silvio-sjsj/computational_physics/tree/main/0_examples)
This folder contains the examples as they are given in the book by the author. They do not represent any original code from me except for the possibility of some minor changes.
