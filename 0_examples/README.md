### Rydberg Formula
This program calculates the wavelengths according to Rydberg's formula. The user inputs the value of n_1, which remains fixed in every loop, and the program iterates over values of n_2 from n_1 + 1 to n_max, also determined by the user. This value represents the number of terms in the series to be computed.
